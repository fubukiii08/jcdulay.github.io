				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>The Philippines is home not only to its people, but to an abundance of social issues and problems as well. Right from the common cases of discrimination up to the manifestations of poverty that kill thousands of people each day, this wide variety of issues have heavily affected large parts of our society.</p>
				<p>As all these problems continue to plague our country, one would think that the government would have addressed these as soon as possible. Yet, we haven’t seen much improvement over the years. This practically sums up why people turn to activism to show opposition to the government. Activism has played an important role in the history of our country, and has led to satisfactory results in some cases. Thus, it is very important to the people.</p>
				<p>However, the government seems to really love muting the voices of those who speak out.</p>

				<h4>The Problem</h4>
				<hr>
				<p>Last July 3, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte officially signed the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 to effectively
replace the Human Security Act of 2007. Authorities are given absolute power to define terrorism and carry
out warrantless arrest using the military and police. In other words, they’re labeling and other people what
they should label themselves as. </p>

				<a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2020/07/03/republic-act-no-11479/">See: Republic Act No. 11479</a>
				<p>Thus, this law endangers activists the most. It gives the government the opportunity to target, imprison, kill,
and suppress political opposition to reinforce their facist regime. Through this, we, the people of this
country, have lost our freedom of speech and human rights.
</p>
				<p>Now, the question is couldn’t they have thought of a better solution? Instead of going to resorts and
swimming with the dolphins like our ever-so cunning Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, couldn’t they
have thought of a way to address whatever concerns the people have so that they would stop rallying?
Instead of throwing birthday parties in the middle of the pandemic like our NCRPO Major Chief Debold
Sinas, couldn’t they have thought of a better way to implement a law that would prevent terrorism? Instead
of shutting us up and violating our basic constitutional rights, couldn’t they have once thought that they are
the ones who caused the oppositions?
</p>
				<p>Well, if taking away our rights and violating the law is how they play this game out, then so be it.</p>

				<h5>The "Well-Though-Out" Proposal</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>The government should just remove all of our constitutional rights and repeal all laws that give us our
freedom and protection. Those who are in opposition against the government technically can’t complain
anymore since they do not have any rights that the government can violate. On the other hand, the
government can completely rule over the people. They can take everything from us and increase their
influence drastically. They could drain us of all our power and resources which would make it impossible for
us to oppose the government.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, these would not even have a huge impact on our mental health, making it a very
well-thought-out solution. It might make us miserable for a while but just take one look at the beauty of the
legendary White Sand Beach made up of premium-quality crushed dolomite on Manila Bay and our spirits
will definitely be lifted up to new heights and our mental health will be better than ever.

				<p>All in all, the solution to all our problems is as easy as taking away all our rights and freedom. Through this
strategical and thought-out solution, rallies won’t occur and the Anti-Terrorism law won’t be needed. Both
sides will get what they want and everyone will be happy.</p>
